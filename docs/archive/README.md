# Documentation Archive

This directory contains historical documentation that chronicles the development journey of VANTAGE.

## What's Archived Here

Documentation in this directory represents:
- **Resolved issues** - Problems that have been fixed in the codebase
- **Development history** - The learning journey of building VANTAGE
- **Context for decisions** - Why certain architectural choices were made
- **Reference material** - Useful for understanding how issues were solved

## Current Archive Contents

- **[docker-development-journey.md](./docker-development-journey.md)** - Chronicles Docker issues encountered during development and their solutions

## Why Archive Instead of Delete?

1. **Learning resource** - Future developers can learn from past challenges
2. **Historical context** - Understanding why the codebase is structured certain ways
3. **Pattern recognition** - If similar issues arise, solutions are documented
4. **Git history preservation** - Git log stays cleaner, but context is still accessible

## When to Add to Archive

Archive documentation when:
- The issue is completely resolved and baked into the codebase
- The problem is unlikely to recur (code now prevents it)
- The documentation is more historical than practical
- It would clutter active troubleshooting guides

## When NOT to Archive

Keep documentation active (in `troubleshooting/` or `guides/`) when:
- The issue could still happen (e.g., port conflicts, environment setup)
- It's a common developer error pattern
- The solution requires manual intervention
- New team members would benefit from the guide
