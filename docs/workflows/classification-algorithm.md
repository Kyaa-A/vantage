# Classification Algorithm (3+1 SGLGB Logic)

> **TODO**: Document the classification algorithm including:
> - Official SGLGB "3+1" scoring logic
> - When classification runs (after final validation)
> - Input data requirements
> - Scoring calculation details
> - Pass/fail determination criteria
> - Compliance status levels
> - Algorithm implementation details
> - Testing the classification logic

## Overview

The Classification Algorithm automatically applies the official "3+1" SGLGB logic to final, validated assessment data to determine the barangay's compliance status (pass/fail).

## The "3+1" Logic

> **TODO**: Document the official SGLGB scoring rules:
> - What does "3+1" mean?
> - How are areas scored?
> - What are the pass/fail thresholds?

## When It Runs

The classification algorithm runs automatically after an assessor performs the final validation during the Table Assessment.

## Algorithm Steps

> **TODO**: Document algorithm steps:
> 1. Gather final validated data
> 2. Calculate scores by governance area
> 3. Apply "3+1" rules
> 4. Determine overall compliance status
> 5. Store results

## Implementation

```python
# TODO: Reference or excerpt from intelligence_service.py
```

## Testing

> **TODO**: Document how to test classification logic

## Example Scenarios

> **TODO**: Provide example scenarios with different scores and outcomes
