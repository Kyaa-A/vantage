## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** 18+ and **pnpm** 8+
- **Python** 3.13+
- **uv** (Python package manager)
- **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase account recommended)
- **Redis** (for Celery background tasks)
- **Docker** (optional, for containerized development)

## Quick Start

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
