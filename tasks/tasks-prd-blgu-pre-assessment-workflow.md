## Summary of Changes for Handling Indicator Hierarchy

### Backend Changes

1. Modify the `indicators` table schema to add `parent_id`:
   - Format: integer, Type: number
   - Constraints: Foreign key referencing `indicators.id`, nullable (top-level allowed)
2. Update SQLAlchemy `Indicator` model:
   - Add `parent_id` column
   - Add self-referencing relationships: `parent` and `children`
3. Generate and apply Alembic migration for the new column and FK constraint

### Backend API Schema & Logic

1. Create recursive Pydantic schema `IndicatorRead` with `children: list[IndicatorRead]`
2. Update service logic to load indicators with children using `selectinload`
3. Return only top-level indicators (`parent_id is None`) with nested `children`

### Frontend Changes

1. Support recursive rendering of indicators in React:
   - Map through top-level indicators and render a `RecursiveIndicator` per item
   - Recursively render `children` with indentation via a `level` prop

### Testing Notes

- **Backend Testing:** Place Pytest tests in `apps/api/tests/`. Test the new `assessment_service` and API endpoints in `assessments.py`. Focus on validating the dynamic `response_data` against the `form_schema`.
- **Frontend Testing:** Place component tests alongside the new components (e.g., `DynamicForm.test.tsx`). Use Vitest and React Testing Library to test form rendering logic and submission workflows.
- **Type Safety:** Ensure the auto-generated types from `@vantage/shared` are used for all data exchange between the frontend and backend.
