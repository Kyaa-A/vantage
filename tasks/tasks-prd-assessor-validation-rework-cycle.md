## Plan Update: Assessor — Replace Mocks, Add Supabase Uploads, and Analytics Endpoint

This section adds a new integration-focused epic to wire existing assessor UI to real backend data, introduce Supabase-backed MOV uploads (server-side only), and provide a minimal analytics endpoint to power current widgets. These changes minimize surface-area by introducing only two new endpoints.

### Additional Relevant Files (new/updated)

- `apps/api/app/core/config.py` (add `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`)
- `apps/api/app/services/storage_service.py` (new)
- `apps/api/app/schemas/assessment.py` (extend with `MOVUploadResponse` if missing)
- `apps/api/app/api/v1/assessor.py` (add routes: uploads, analytics)
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/submissions/page.tsx` (wire queue)
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/dashboard/page.tsx` (fetch queue in client subcomponent)
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/analytics/page.tsx` (replace mocks with hook)
- `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/assessments/[id]/ValidationControls.tsx` (multipart upload)
- `apps/web/src/hooks/useAssessor.ts` (new hooks for analytics and upload)

### 4.0 Epic: Integration & Analytics

- [ ] 4.1 Story: Backend — Supabase Integration

  - [ ] 4.1.1 Atomic: Add settings and env vars
    - Files: `apps/api/app/core/config.py`, `apps/api/.env`
    - Acceptance: `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY` defined in `Settings` and loaded from `.env` (local) or environment (prod). Keys never exposed to frontend.
  - [ ] 4.1.2 Atomic: Implement `storage_service.py`
    - Files: `apps/api/app/services/storage_service.py` (new)
    - Acceptance: Service initializes Supabase client with service-role key and implements `upload_mov(file, *, response_id)` that stores files under bucket `movs` with prefix `assessment-{assessment_id}/response-{response_id}/`. Returns stored path and metadata suitable for persistence.

- [ ] 4.2 Story: Backend — MOV Upload Endpoint (Assessor)

  - [ ] 4.2.1 Atomic: Add multipart upload route
    - Files: `apps/api/app/api/v1/assessor.py`, `apps/api/app/schemas/assessment.py`, `apps/api/app/services/assessor_service.py`
    - Acceptance: `POST /api/v1/assessor/assessment-responses/{response_id}/movs/upload` accepts `multipart/form-data` (`file`, optional `filename`), validates assessor permissions (existing firewall in `deps.py`), uploads via `storage_service`, creates MOV record marked as "Uploaded by Assessor", and returns `MOVUploadResponse` including stored path and MOV entity. Existing JSON-based BLGU MOV endpoints remain unchanged.
    - Note: Do not expose Supabase credentials; only persist storage path/URL in DB. Signed URLs can be added later.

- [ ] 4.3 Story: Backend — Assessor Analytics Endpoint

  - [ ] 4.3.1 Atomic: Add analytics route and service method(s)
    - Files: `apps/api/app/api/v1/assessor.py`, `apps/api/app/schemas/assessor.py`, `apps/api/app/services/assessor_service.py`
    - Acceptance: `GET /api/v1/assessor/analytics` returns `AssessorAnalyticsResponse` covering current UI widgets:
      - `overview`: totals and trend series
      - `hotspots`: top underperforming indicators/areas with reasons
      - `workflow`: counts/durations by status
    - Start minimal using existing assessment/response data and extend as UI grows.

- [ ] 4.4 Story: OpenAPI and Types

  - [ ] 4.4.1 Atomic: Ensure routes are in main router and regenerate clients
    - Files: `apps/api/app/api/v1/assessor.py`, root `orval.config.ts`
    - Acceptance: New endpoints appear in OpenAPI; run `pnpm generate` at repo root to refresh `@vantage/shared` client types and functions.

- [ ] 4.5 Story: Frontend — Wire Submissions and Dashboard

  - [ ] 4.5.1 Atomic: Replace queue mocks on Submissions page
    - Files: `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/submissions/page.tsx`, `apps/web/src/hooks/useAssessor.ts`
    - Acceptance: Use `useAssessorQueue()` (generated client + TanStack Query) instead of `generateSubmissionsData`. Preserve existing filters and map to current UI shape.
  - [ ] 4.5.2 Atomic: Dashboard uses real queue via client subcomponent
    - Files: `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/dashboard/page.tsx`
    - Acceptance: Fetch queue client-side and pass items to `<SubmissionsQueue />` without breaking current UI.

- [ ] 4.6 Story: Frontend — Analytics

  - [ ] 4.6.1 Atomic: Replace analytics mocks with hook
    - Files: `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/analytics/page.tsx`, `apps/web/src/hooks/useAssessor.ts`
    - Acceptance: Implement `useAssessorAnalytics()` (generated from `/assessor/analytics`) and adapt widget prop mapping to the API response shape.

- [ ] 4.7 Story: Frontend — MOV Upload in Validation Flow
  - [ ] 4.7.1 Atomic: Use multipart endpoint in validation controls
    - Files: `apps/web/src/app/(app)/assessor/assessments/[id]/ValidationControls.tsx`, `apps/web/src/hooks/useAssessor.ts`
    - Acceptance: Remove mock storage path usage, submit file via multipart upload mutation; on success invalidate assessor detail query to reflect new MOVs.

### Config & Security

- Do not expose Supabase keys to the frontend. Use service-role key in backend only. Persist storage path/URL; serve signed URLs later if needed.

### Testing & Ops Notes

- Backend tests: add unit tests for `storage_service` and endpoint tests for upload and analytics. Use `pytest -vv --log-cli-level=DEBUG` under `apps/api/tests/`.
- Frontend tests: component-level tests for analytics widgets mapping and upload action wiring.
- Types regeneration: after backend routes exist, run `pnpm generate` to refresh `@vantage/shared`.
- Migrations: none expected for this epic; if DB schema changes become necessary, follow Alembic guidelines and never modify old migrations. Always test `upgrade` and `downgrade` locally.

### Testing Notes

- **Backend Testing:** Place Pytest tests in `apps/api/tests/`. Test services and API endpoints separately. Run with `pytest -vv --log-cli-level=DEBUG`.
- **Frontend Testing:** Place test files alongside components (`.test.tsx`). Use Vitest and React Testing Library.
- **Type Safety:** Import auto-generated types from `@vantage/shared` to ensure frontend and backend are in sync.
- **Run Tests:** Use `pnpm test` from the root, which will run tests for all workspaces.
