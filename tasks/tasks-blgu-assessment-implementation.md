# BLGU Assessment Implementation Tasks

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the comprehensive BLGU "My Assessment" page for the VANTAGE web application. This is the most complex and critical component for BLGU users, providing a guided workspace for completing SGLGB pre-assessments.

## âœ… Completed Implementation

- **IndicatorStatus**: Enum for indicator states (not_started, completed, needs_rework)
- **GovernanceArea**: Interface for governance areas with indicators
- **Indicator**: Interface for individual assessment indicators
- **MOVFile**: Interface for uploaded Means of Verification files
- **Assessment**: Main assessment interface with all related data
- **AssessmentValidation**: Interface for validation results
- **Mock Data**: Comprehensive mock data for development and testing

### 2. Assessment Hooks (`apps/web/src/hooks/useAssessment.ts`)

- **Tab Navigation**: Breaks indicators into manageable chunks
- **Accordion Interface**: Prevents overwhelming wall of form fields
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Users focus on one indicator at a time

### 2. Smart Validation System
- **Real-time Validation**: Checks completion status continuously
- **Detailed Tooltips**: Shows exactly what's missing
- **Submit Button Control**: Only enabled when all requirements met
- **MOV Requirements**: Ensures files uploaded for "Yes" answers

### 3. Three-State System
- **In Progress**: Full editing capabilities
- **Needs Rework**: Shows assessor comments, only flagged items editable

- **Visual Prominence**: Orange styling with warning icon
- **Conditional Display**: Only visible during rework state

### 5. File Management
- **Drag-and-Drop Upload**: Intuitive file handling
- **File Validation**: Type and size restrictions
- **Progress Indicators**: Loading states for uploads
- **File Management**: View and delete capabilities
- **File Information**: Size, upload date, filename display

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Details

### State Management
- **React Query**: For server state management
- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI feedback
- **Cache Invalidation**: Proper data synchronization
- **Error Handling**: Graceful error states

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Shadcn UI Components**: Consistent design system
- **Responsive Design**: Works on all screen sizes
