# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Stage 2: Dependencies

# Copy dependency files
COPY pyproject.toml uv.lock ./

# Install dependencies using uv
RUN uv pip install --system --no-cache -r pyproject.toml

# Stage 3: Development (includes dev dependencies)
FROM dependencies as development

# Install dev dependencies
RUN uv pip install --system --no-cache -e ".[dev]"
