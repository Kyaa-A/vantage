# ðŸ”§ System Database Models
# This file is reserved for future system-related database tables
# such as application settings, feature flags, etc.
#
# Note: HealthCheck and other system responses are Pydantic schemas
# and belong in app/schemas/system.py, not here.

# Currently no database tables needed for basic system functionality.
# Future tables might include:
# - AppSettings (for configuration storage)
# - FeatureFlags (for feature toggles)
# - SystemLogs (for audit trails)
